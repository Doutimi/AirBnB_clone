# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

During this project, I learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages to build the front end step-by-step.

The first step was to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

1. Create simple HTML static pages
2. Style guide
3. Fake contents
4. No Javascript
5. No data loaded from anything
