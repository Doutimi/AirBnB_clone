# The AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description
This project is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

## Description of the command interpreter
The interface of the application is similar to Bash shell. The difference is that it has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

- Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
- Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Updating attributes of an object
- Destroying an object
